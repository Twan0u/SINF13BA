# Computer Language Concepts
## S3
### Determinstic Dataflow
#### Single assignement variables
Single assignement : une variable can ba bound to only one value un memory
data structures can contains unbound variables :
#### Partial values
ex:
``` oz
declare A B C L in
L=[ABC]
{Browse L} //display [_ _ _]
```
### Dataflow principle
**Concept of dataflow** : the availibility drives the execution
```
declare
Y=X+1 // X is unbound and the program will wait for X  
```
if we wait, someone else need to bound this variable. so we introduce the concept of thread (State of the execution). They can be multiple threads inside the program. The execution continue when the data becomes available

#### Concurrency and thread
be carefull whith this because you create a *activity* inside the system (thread) each time you unbound a varaible
**Thread** : sequence in execution
thread < S > end : create a thread.
We can have multiple threads simultaniously(+- because only one cpu)
the execution uses 'interleaving semantics' : one cpu, multiple threads that are sharing this calculation power at the same time. interleaving : the system will perform only one sequence of steps in the execution. concurrency does not apply parallelism. so no need of multiple cores.
parallelism : small number (4-8 cores so 4-8 processes at the same time)
concurrency : hundreds at the same time

each step is the thread is choose by the scheduller (ordonnanceur).

### the execution tree
it shows all possibile exÃ©cutions (all possible ways in the execution)
```
declare A B C in
thread A=1 end
thread B=2 end
thread C=A+B end
```

#### stream
a non nil list is used to pass informatin trough the program

#### ping-pong
a thread need to display ping pong, in alternance with thread1 saying ping and the other pong. how should threads do this ?
threads should communicate
```
declare
fun {Ping S}
  case S of ok|T then
  {browse ping}
  ok|{Ping T}
  end
end
fun {Pong S}
  case S of ok|T then
  {browse Pong}
  ok|{Pong T}
  end
end
declare S1 S2 in
thread S2={Ping ok|S1} end //ok| is used to initialise the ping pong
thread S1={Pong S2} end
```
#S7
##Message passing concurrency (ch5)
###Ports and port Objects
####Ports
####Port Objects
Port object = port + thread + function
port object has a internal State
F : msg x state -> State
I : initial State
```
declare
fun {NewPortObject F I}
  proc {Loop S State}
    case S of M|T then
      {Loop T {F M State}}
    end
  end
  P
in
  thread S in P = {NewPort S} {Loop S I}end
  P
end
//counter Objects

declare
Ctr = {NewPortObject
  fun{$ Msg State}
    case Msg
    of inc(X) then State+X
    [] dec(X) then State-X
    [] get(X) then X = State State
    end
  end
  0}
  ```
###Playball exemple
exemple of non deterministic execution
here it comes from random numbers but it can comes from an other source
```
declare
fun{Player Others}
  {NewPortObject
    fun {$ Msg State}
      case Msg
      of ball then Ran in
        Ran = ({OS.rand} mod {Width Others})+1
        {Send Others.Ran ball}
        State+1
      [] get(X) then X= State State
      end
    end
    0}
end

 //init the game
declare  P1 P2 P3 in
P1 = {Player others(P2 P3)}
P2 = {Player others(P1 P3)}
P3 = {Player others(P1 P2)}

local X in {Send P1 get(X)} {Browse X} end
local X in {Send P2 get(X)} {Browse X} end
local X in {Send P3 get(X)} {Browse X} end
{Send P1 ball}
```

###Message Protocols
Rules for agents talking to each others
####RMI
simple port with no internal State
Will run forever ( but not bad because accept always new messages )
```
fun {NexPortObject2 Proc}
  P
in
  thread S in
    P ={NewPort S}
  for M in S do {Proc M} end
  end
  P
end

```
Rmi :
```
declare
proc{ServerProc Msg}
  case Msg of calc(X Y) then
    Y = X*X+2.0*X+234.3
  end
end
Server = {NewPortObject2 ServerProc}

local Y in {Send Server calc(1.0 Y)} {Browse Y} end

// Client
declare
proc{ClientProc Msg}
  case Msg of work(Y) then Y1 Y2 in
    {Send Server calc(1.0 Y1)}
    {wait Y1}
    {Send Server calc{2.0 Y2}}
    {wait Y2}
    Y=Y1+Y2
  end
end
Client = {NewPortObject2 ClientProc}

// DO the work
declare Y in
{Send Client work(Y)}
{Browse Y}
```

#### Async Rmi
twice as fast
better in online and real world application
```
// Client Async
declare
proc{ClientProc Msg}
  case Msg of work(Y) then Y1 Y2 in
    {Send Server calc(1.0 Y1)}
    {Send Server calc{2.0 Y2}}
    {wait Y1} % MOVE THIS <--------------------
    {wait Y2}
    Y=Y1+Y2
  end
end
Client2 = {NewPortObject2 ClientProc}

// DO the work
declare Y in
{Send Client2 work(Y)}
{Browse Y}
```

#### RMI with Callback (thread)
good only with cheap threads (ex: ERLANG)
```
declare
proc{ServerProc Msg}
  case Msg of calc(X Y Client) then D in
    {Send Client delta(D)}
    Y = X*X+2.0*D*X+D*D+23.0
    end
end
Server = {NewPortObject2 ServerProc}

declare
proc{ClientProc Msg}
  case Msg of work(Z) then Y in
    {Send Server calc(10.0 Y Client)}
    thread Z = Y+10 end <---- avoid DeaDlock1 by threading
    [] delta(D) then

    D = 0.1
  end
end
Client = {NewPortObject2 ClientProc}

declare Z in
{Send Client work(Z)}
{Browse Z}
```

**DeaDlock** : Circular wait
client wait Server and Server wait Client

restart server -> if he is deadlocked

#### RMI with Callback (Record Continuation)
If threads are expensives (ex: JAVA)

Split method  into pieces that don't wait

cont(Y Z) is a record (data structure)
Need to pas y to server which is passed back

```
declare
proc{ServerProc Msg}
  case Msg of calc(X Client Y) then
    {Send Client delta(D)} <--get info from Server
    Y = X*X+2.0*D*X+D*D+23.0
    {Send Client cont(Y Z)} <-- gives result to client
    end
end
Server = {NewPortObject2 ServerProc}

declare
proc{ClientProc Msg}
  case Msg of work(Z) then Y in
    {Send Server calc(10.0 Client Y)}
    [] cont(Y Z) then
      Z = Y+10.0
    [] delta(D) then
    D = 0.1
  end
end
Client = {NewPortObject2 ClientProc}

declare Z in
{Send Client work(Z)}
{Browse Z}
```

#### RMI with Callback (procedure Continuation)
Use high-order programming
```
declare
proc{ServerProc Msg}
  case Msg of calc(X Client Y contProc) then Z D in
    {Send Client delta(D)}
    Y = X*X+2.0*D*X+D*D+23.0
    {Send Client cont(Y Z)}
    end
end
Server = {NewPortObject2 ServerProc}

declare
proc{ClientProc Msg}
  case Msg of work(Y) then Z in
    {Send Server calc(10.0 Client Z proc{$} Y = Z+10.0 end)}
    [] p(ContProc) then
      {ContProc}
    [] delta(D) then
    D = 0.1
  end
end
Client = {NewPortObject2 ClientProc}

declare Z in
{Send Client work(Z)}
{Browse Z}
```

#### Async RMI with Callback (Do it yourself)

### Active objects and passive objects (Classes)
#### Port Objects -> tran?? sem??
 F  : Msg x State -> state
#### Active Objects -> Classes
  c : i = i+1 ( read implicit )
  OZ : i:=@i + 1
  Pascal modua and @ do the read of the value
  ```
  declare
  class Counter
    attr i
    meth init(X)
      i:=X
    end
    meth inc(X)
      i:=@i + X
    end
    meth get(X)
      X=@i
    end
  end

  declare
  Ctr = {Newcounter init(0)}

  local X in {Ctr get(X)} {Browse X} end
  {Ctr inc(10)}
  ```

#### Passive objets
{ctr inc(0)}
i :=@i +1
executed in the caller thread
feeds the thread like a parasite
